   <h1> History Rwandans at University of Nebraska Lincoln </h1>
   <p> The Rwandan community at the University of Nebraska Lincoln is on of the majority of international students here on campus. They are pursuing a bachelor's degree in Integrated Science. Integrated Science was designed to help the student to have an idea of what is sustainable agriculture and apply leadership and Entrepreneurship in their communities.
     The first Cohort came in the fall semester of 2015. It was not an easy way for them to cooperate with the life on campus. During that time they came they had to find out how to live in the new and unusual life on campus. <!-- speech with Rodrigue and Christian -->

     <p> this cohort graduated in the May 2019 as the class of 2019. It was a great graduation ceremony where some of their parents attended. This one of the achievements of the CUSP committee to see their first cohort graduating. <!-- ask for interview with Tiffany or any of the CUSP leadership committee --> </p>
     
     
     <p>After 2015 until 2019 there were other four cohorts which came after. Each cohort was made of 50 students. In total the program brought to The University of Nebraska Lincoln 205 students. This number would not get if there was no partnership between the Government of Rwanda and the donnor of the Program</p>

   <h6>Life of Rwandans here at On Campus </h6>
        <p> the life of Rwandan students here at the University of Nebraska Lincoln is not different from other international students.<br> The CUSP scholars are more involved in different activities here on campus. For example the RSOs and also other organizations. On the Other hand, as the culture of many Rwandans, most of students come from Christian backgrounds, thus when they came here in Nebraska they continued to go to Pray and involve in Religious activities here on campus.</p>

   <h4> Yearly planned events</h4>
  <!-- <p>Although the phrase is nonsense, it does have a long history. The phrase has been used for several centuries by typographers to show the most distinctive features of their fonts. It is used because the letters involved and the letter spacing in those combinations reveal, at their best, the weight, design, and other important features of the typeface.
 A 1994 issue of "Before & After" magazine traces "Lorem ipsum ..." to a jumbled Latin version of a passage from de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum, a treatise on the theory of ethics written by Cicero in 45 B.C. The passage "Lorem ipsum ..." is taken from text that reads, Although the phrase is nonsense, it does have a long history. The phrase has been used for several centuries by typographers to show s
 "Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit ...," which translates as, "There is no one who loves pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is pain..."
 During the 1500s, a printer adapted Cicero's text to develop a page of type samples. Since then, the Latin-like text has been the printing industry's standard for fake, or dummy, text. Before electronic publishing, graphic designers had to mock up layouts by drawing in squiggled lines to indicate text. The advent of self-adhesive sheets preprinted with "Lorem ipsum" gave a more realistic way to indicate where text would go on a page</p> -->
